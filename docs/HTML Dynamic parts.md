Dynamic parts of the webpage

List of Dynamic parts and problems that could arise:

    • For example the number next to Things to buy is dynamic because we cannot predict how many items the user will add to their list. Adding onto this the number should decrease once things are deleted. 
    • The text input box is dynamic as the user has to input the text correctly, a problem could be they may try to list everything at once rather than as separate items. Spelling mistakes and none text items may also be inputted which is difficult to change once added or not what is required.
      Another problem with this input box could be adding quanties to it for instance if you wanted 2 cakes, you would have to input the cakes twice. This would take a lot of time. Similarly it depends on how much detail the user inputs they could just put cakes or they could put in red velvet cakes so the amount of text inputted varies with detail. Another problem is the size of the box may cut off the users entry or be too small to add the full item name. 

    • The buttons are also dynamic as they require the user to click them which will then either remove it from the list or create a new list eventually. Currently there is no way to undo an accidental click or save items on the list. This also means the user can no longer see what they have ‘bought’ or ‘saved’ to another lsit if not in stock so crossing the item out might help this rather than deleting it.
